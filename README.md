# KiCad-Sensorless-BLDC-ESC

I designed this pcb because I want to be able to try different microcontrollers as part of Electronic Speed Controller projects. It can be used with the microcontrollers those don't have the internal comparator capability.

In version 0.2 it will be much smaller and compact.

--------- Version 0.2 UPDATE ---------

PCB holds only 10x10 cm^2 now. It only needs to be tested with the software.
