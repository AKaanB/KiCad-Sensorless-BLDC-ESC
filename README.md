# KiCad-Sensorless-BLDC-ESC

I designed this pcb because I want to be able to try different microcontrollers as part of Electronic Speed Controller projects. It can be used with the microcontrollers those don't have the internal comparator capability.

This is the 0.1 version. In version 0.2 it will be much smaller and compact.
