# KiCad-Sensorless-BLDC-ESC

I designed this pcb because I want to be able to try different microcontrollers as part of Electronic Speed Controller projects. It can be used with especially the microcontrollers those don't have the internal comparator capability.

I ordered the version 0.3 and will test it when it arrives.
